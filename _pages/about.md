I am a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I work with Prof. [Sara Achour](https://www.sara-achour.me/) on software systems for unconventional analog computing and hardware-algorithm co-design. I am in general interested in developing new tools for productivites.
